The idea for this project is to create a car auction site with more details to follow.

The auction site shall permit registered users to list cars for sale and registered users
to browse a catalog and select a car for making a bid or offer at a reserve price. Users can
also subscribe to car watch lists to track cars that they are interested in. Payment for a car
shall be very simple pseudo payment and shall not involve user quality tracking or linking to 
payment gateways.Conor.

I feel that further developments of the enterprise project will be made based on team players'
understanding and continued learning acquired from this module. Cezar
